    <h3>ABOUT US</h3>
    <img src="../images/about/volunteer.jpg">
      <p>Project H.E.L.L.O. is a grassroots project that began in 2009 when students in Coquitlam, BC decided to help the
        homeless on Vancouver's Downtown Eastside during the Christmas season. Project H.E.L.L.O. is now a year round project,
        run by students, staff and alumni of Dr. Charles Best Secondary and Thomas Haney Secondary. They help the
        homeless reconnect and repair relationships through cards, phone calls, and face to face reunions.</p>

      <h3>HOW IT'S DONE</h3>
    <p>Rather than solely giving handouts, students and teachers decided to provide the homeless with the power to give back. With carefully
      hand crafted, beautiful cards on hand, the homeless are invited to write to their friends or family with whom
      they may have lost touch. Once we locate their loved ones, we give them the cards and reunite them.</p>
