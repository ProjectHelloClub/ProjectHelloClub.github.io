                Beyond Hello started when Kristi Blakeway and a group of highschool students decided to make a positive impact in their community by helping the homeless.
                To explain her journey, Kristi wrote a book called "Beyond Hello Rekindling the human spirit one conversation at a time."

                How it all started
            </h1>
            <p>
                In November of 2009, while reading the local newspaper, an idea hit Kristi
                that included the simple act of talking to strangers. She decided to help the homeless on the down town eastside (DTES)
            </p>

            <p>
                "I am embarrassed to say I once judged the homeless with my preconceived notions.
                Like many, I assumed most of the people in homeless shelters had made bad decisions, or let addiction ruin their lives."
                    - Kristi Blakeway
            </p>

            <p>
                Not only were there people who became homeless because of bad decision or addiction, but there were lots of people who had no control over it.
                They had no choice but to become homeless.
